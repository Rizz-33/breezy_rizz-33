## Project Overview

I built a simple yet insightful weather reporter app named "Breezy" where users can search for any city and view comprehensive weather details such as humidity, wind speed, UV index, pressure, precipitation, visibility, cloud cover, air quality, sunrise, and sunset times. The app also features a dynamic forecast component that provides hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly insights. Additionally, it includes smart weather tips based on current conditions—for example, “Don't forget your umbrella! It's raining ☔” or “Perfect weather for outdoor activities! Enjoy the sunshine ☀️”. I’ve also implemented a theme toggle allowing users to switch between dark and light themes, with the initial state showing Colombo's weather in dark mode with weekly insights.
